# CSFinalProject
The final project for CS:Problem Solving and Solutions has us creating a program for use with audio files. Our program is meant to recieve an audio file and convert it to a .wav file if nesasery. 
After doing so, it will offer the user options to plot the graph of aplitude vs time, the graph of the highest frequencies, the graph of the lowest frequencies, the graph of the middle frequencies,
and a graph of those three frequencies combined. The program also helps to clean up the audio file by geting rid of mata data that is not needed. 

This project exsists in order to give a look at how different portions of the problem solving process can come together to solve a problem. In this case the project gave us experiance with working
as a team and designing a scrum board, working on coding tasks together and communicating with the other members in order to plan the process we decided to follow. The program itself helps to view
data that could be useful in designing rooms in order to make the voice intelligibility better.

To use this program, open in pycharm. Then click the run button. After click the browse button on the pop up and look for the file on your computer. After selecting the file click the load button.
Check the message at the bottom of the pop up to see if the load was succesful. After a successful load, click on the plot button to plot the amplitude vs time. Click the Time button to see the time
of the graph.  If you want to see the graph for the highest frequency click on the button labeled, high frequency. Click the button labeled low frequency for the low frequency graph. Click on the button
labeled middle frequency for the graph of middle frequencies. Click on the combined graph button to see the combined frequencies graph. Click the x in the top right to close the pop up.
