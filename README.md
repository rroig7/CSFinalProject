# CSFinalProject
The final project for CS:Problem Solving and Solutions has us creating a program for use with audio files. Our program is meant to recieve an audio file and convert it to a .wav file if nesasery. 
After doing so, it will offer the user options to plot the graph of aplitude vs time, the graph of the highest frequencies, the graph of the lowest frequencies, the graph of the middle frequencies,
and a graph of those three frequencies combined. The program also helps to clean up the audio file by geting rid of mata data that is not needed.
